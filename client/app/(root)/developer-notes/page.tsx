                  &quot;Dearest Ammu, this application is not just software â€” it is not just lines of code, algorithms, or functions. 
                  It is my soul speaking to you in a different language: the language of effort, sincerity, and love.&quot;

                Some people say that time heals all wounds, but I&apos;ve learned that healing comes not from time alone, but from growth, understanding, and genuine change. I know my actions hurt you deeply, and no application or project could ever erase that pain. But I hope this small creation of mine can be a tiny window into how much you mean to me and how committed I am to being worthy of your trust again.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                This StudyControl app represents more than just lines of codeâ€”it&apos;s my way of showing that I want to support your dreams as much as my own. Each feature was built with you in mind, thinking about how I could make your MBBS journey just a little bit easier. Just as I&apos;ve recalibrated my career path to align with your medical world, I&apos;ve realigned my heart to understand what truly matters.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                I cannot hide from the truth of what I did. I must face it, speak it, and own it â€” because without acknowledging the darkness, there can be no light. I made you feel unseen when you should have been celebrated, unheard when your voice should have been my guiding star, and insensitive when you needed gentleness.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                When you said the word breakup, I felt my world collapse. At that moment, it was not just a relationship ending â€” it was the breaking of my very being. The silence that followed was louder than any argument, showing me flashes of your tears, your hurt, your disappointment.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                But love has a way of awakening people. The pain of losing you became my Kurukshetra â€” my battlefield. In the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna reminds Arjuna that the greatest battles are not fought outside, but within. You became both my Krishna and my Kurukshetra: the guiding voice showing me where I went wrong, the battlefield where I fought my greatest enemy â€” myself.
              </p>

                I&apos;ve learned that love isn&apos;t about possession but about partnership. It isn&apos;t about insecurity but about building security together. The changes I&apos;ve made aren&apos;t temporary or conditionalâ€”they&apos;re the foundation of who I want to be, with or without you in my life. But I&apos;m eternally grateful that you&apos;re willing to give us another chance.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                You are seen in every decision I make. You are heard in every plan I create. You are valued in every sacrifice that doesn&apos;t feel like sacrifice at all. And you are lovedâ€”completely, consistently, and without reservation.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                I began rebuilding myself from the ground up. I worked on patience where I once rushed. I worked on listening where I once dismissed. I worked on humility where I once carried arrogance. Today, I stand not as the boy who once took you for granted, but as the man who will respect you in every word and every silence.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Just as Shah Jahan built the Taj Mahal as a monument of love for Mumtaz, I dedicate this application to you. Not built from marble, but from sincerity. Every line of code, every feature, every design is a reflection of how much you mean to me.
