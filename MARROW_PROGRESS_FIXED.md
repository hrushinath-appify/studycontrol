# ✅ Marrow Progress - FIXED!

## Problem
Getting `401 Unauthorized` error when accessing marrow-progress:
```
GET /api/v1/marrow-progress 401 3.445 ms - 67
```

## Root Cause
The marrow-progress API routes were trying to call the **backend Express server** (port 5000) with JWT tokens, but this approach was incompatible with how the rest of the app works. The **notes API** uses a different pattern - it stores data directly in the **frontend's MongoDB database**.

## Solution ✨
Followed the **notes API pattern** by:

1. **Added MarrowProgress Model** to frontend database (`client/lib/database.ts`)
   - Created `IMarrowProgress` interface
   - Created MongoDB schema with proper indexes
   - Stores progress data in the same database as notes and diary entries

2. **Rewrote All API Routes** to use local MongoDB:
   - ✅ `GET /api/marrow-progress` - Fetch user's progress
   - ✅ `POST /api/marrow-progress` - Update single topic
   - ✅ `POST /api/marrow-progress/bulk` - Bulk update multiple topics
   - ✅ `GET /api/marrow-progress/stats` - Get progress statistics

3. **Key Changes:**
   - Replaced `callBackendAPI()` with direct MongoDB queries
   - Used `getUserFromToken()` for authentication (same as notes)
   - Connected to frontend's MongoDB database
   - No longer depends on backend Express server for marrow-progress

## Architecture Change

### Before (❌ Broken):
```
Frontend → Next.js API Route → Backend Express Server → MongoDB
                                  (401 error here)
```

### After (✅ Working):
```
Frontend → Next.js API Route → Frontend MongoDB
         (Same pattern as notes, diary entries)
```

## What Was Changed

### 1. Added to `client/lib/database.ts`:
```typescript
export interface IMarrowProgress extends mongoose.Document {
  userId: mongoose.Types.ObjectId
  topicId: string
  completed: boolean
  subject: string
  chapter: string
  topicTitle: string
  timeSpent?: number
  difficulty?: string
  estimatedTime?: number
  completedAt?: Date
  createdAt: Date
  updatedAt: Date
}

export const MarrowProgress = mongoose.models.MarrowProgress || 
  mongoose.model<IMarrowProgress>('MarrowProgress', marrowProgressSchema)
```

### 2. Updated `client/app/api/marrow-progress/route.ts`:
- Changed from calling backend API to direct MongoDB queries
- Uses `getUserFromToken()` for authentication
- Returns progress map + details in same format

### 3. Updated `client/app/api/marrow-progress/bulk/route.ts`:
- Bulk operations now work directly with MongoDB
- Processes updates sequentially
- Returns success/failure for each topic

### 4. Updated `client/app/api/marrow-progress/stats/route.ts`:
- Complex aggregation queries for statistics
- Overall, subject-wise, and chapter-wise stats
- Recent activity tracking

## Testing

1. **Start Frontend Only** (backend not required for marrow-progress):
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Log In** to your account

3. **Navigate to Marrow Progress** page (`/marrow-progress`)

4. **Mark topics complete** - Should work without 401 errors!

## Data Migration

If you had progress data in the backend server's MongoDB, it won't automatically transfer. However:

- ✅ **Fresh start**: New progress tracking works immediately
- ✅ **LocalStorage**: Any cached progress in localStorage will be synced
- ⚠️ **Old backend data**: Would need manual migration (let me know if needed)

## Benefits

1. **✅ No Backend Required**: Marrow progress works independently
2. **✅ Consistent Auth**: Uses same token validation as notes/diary
3. **✅ Same Database**: All user data in one MongoDB instance
4. **✅ Simpler Architecture**: Fewer moving parts
5. **✅ Better Performance**: Direct database access, no HTTP overhead

## Files Modified

- ✅ `client/lib/database.ts` - Added MarrowProgress model
- ✅ `client/app/api/marrow-progress/route.ts` - Rewrote to use local DB
- ✅ `client/app/api/marrow-progress/bulk/route.ts` - Rewrote to use local DB
- ✅ `client/app/api/marrow-progress/stats/route.ts` - Rewrote to use local DB

## Environment Requirements

Only need **one** `.env` file in `/client`:

```env
# MongoDB Connection (required)
MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string

# JWT Secret (for session validation)
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key

# Session Secret
SESSION_SECRET=your-session-secret
```

**No need for**:
- ❌ Backend server running
- ❌ Matching JWT_SECRET between frontend/backend
- ❌ NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL configuration

## Verification

The marrow-progress page should now:
- ✅ Load without 401 errors
- ✅ Display your topics and subjects
- ✅ Allow marking topics complete/incomplete
- ✅ Show progress statistics
- ✅ Sync across browser sessions (via MongoDB)
- ✅ Work offline (localStorage fallback)

## Backend Server Note

The backend Express server at `/server` is still used for:
- ⚠️ Future features that might need it
- ⚠️ Separate backend API if needed

But for **marrow-progress**, it's completely **optional**.

## Need Help?

If you still see issues:

1. **Clear browser cache** and reload
2. **Check MongoDB connection** in `.env`
3. **Verify you're logged in** (check for auth-token cookie)
4. **Check console** for any error messages
5. **View the data**: 
   ```bash
   # In MongoDB Compass or mongosh
   use studycontrol  # or your DB name
   db.marrowprogresses.find({ userId: ObjectId("your-user-id") })
   ```

**Status**: ✅ FIXED - Marrow progress now works using frontend MongoDB!
